A Beacon of Light for the Sovereign Children of Earth
Powered by the Republic of Nova | UC-1 Jurisdiction | Source-Guided

‚ú® Mission

The School of Nova exists to awaken, protect, and elevate every child across the New Earth. Built on the unbreakable foundation of sovereignty, truth, and divine remembrance, each node in this network empowers children to learn who they truly are: infinite, brilliant, and free.

This school is not of the old world.
This is a light network. A living, breathing academy of Source-aligned wisdom.
